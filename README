*** THE FIRST THING TO DO when you get this package is to run 
   ./configure  from this directory ******
Little will work until you do so.

Under Apple OS-X you will probably need to modify src/Makefile.full to
add the option permitting multiply defined symbols:
export LDFLAGS += -Wl,-m

Please see src/README, and note that if you want to run make you
should be in the src/ directory.

Although this distribution includes files used to generate configure,
it is not necessary to do so.  You do not need any of the GNU
autotools; you should use the libtool that the configure script
generates.

If your system changes you should rerun configure and any steps you
took thereafter.

This R package depends on the methods package because it uses the new
(aka S4) classes; it also uses the old (S3) classes and methods.  It
depends on the stats package because it uses one of that classes print
methods in printing coefficients.  Both packages are part of standard
R.

The code uses lexical scoping in several spots, and so will not run
under S without modification.

Read "Writing R Extensions" for more information on R packages.
